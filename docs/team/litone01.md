## Project: SOChedule (to be continued)

### Overview
SOChedule is a one-stop solution for managing tasks and events, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Summary of contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature 1**: Added the ability to mark multiple tasks as done.
    * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature 2**: Added the ability to mark a completed task as uncompleted.

* **New Feature 3**: Added the ability to help users find their schedule.

    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())
